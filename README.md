# IoT Smart Home System

## Overview

The IoT Smart Home System is a distributed microcontroller-based solution designed to manage lighting, temperature, and access control within a smart home environment. The system utilizes ESP32 microcontrollers and ESP-NOW communication protocol to enable seamless interaction between devices.

## Key Features

* **Distributed System**: The setup comprises four microcontrollers, each responsible for specific tasks such as controlling lighting, monitoring temperature, and managing access control mechanisms.

* **ESP32 Microcontrollers**: Leveraging the capabilities of ESP32, the system ensures efficient processing and communication between devices.

* **ESP-NOW Communication**: Utilizes ESP-NOW, a low-power, peer-to-peer communication protocol developed by Espressif, to facilitate direct communication between devices without the need for a Wi-Fi router.

## Development Tools

* **PlatformIO**: The firmware for the microcontrollers was developed using PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem for IoT development.
